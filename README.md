README for Project Math

Purpose: To create a library of methods and objects for mathematical calculation

Plans:

  Create an Angle System:
    Radians,
    Degrees

  Vectors:
    Unit Vectors,
    3D Vectors

  Polar Coordinates

  Error nullification
    if a number is 0.0000001 away from a more rational number than the number
      rounds

  TODO: ADD points for 2D math, Check data protection

  And MORE...

Version 0.0.1:
  Angles

Version 0.0.2:
  Vectors,
  Unit Vectors

Version 0.0.3:
  Vector Math

Version 0.0.4:
  Basic 3D objects(points, lines, and vectors)
